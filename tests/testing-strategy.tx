# 🛡️ Testing Strategy for We The Parent™ (Zero-Cost Environment)

This document outlines the testing methodologies used to ensure the stability and reliability of the application while strictly adhering to a **zero-cost** operational model during development and Continuous Integration (CI).

## 1. Core Principles

1.  **Mock Everything External:** All third-party services (Supabase, Gemini/Groq, External APIs) must be intercepted and mocked during automated testing. This eliminates flakiness and prevents unnecessary API charges.
2.  **Focus on Data Flow:** Tests prioritize checking the integrity of data transformations (e.g., input -> API route -> mock database structure) and complex rendering flows (e.g., streaming chat).
3.  **Authentication Simulation:** Since the project is currently single-user, authentication is simulated using Playwright's `storageState` to ensure all pages are tested under a logged-in state without hitting the live authentication endpoint.

## 2. Test Suites and Tools

| Test Type | Tooling | Purpose in Zero-Cost Model |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Unit/Integration Tests** | **Jest/Vitest** | Validates individual component logic, utility functions, and hooks. **CRITICAL:** Uses Jest's `__mocks__` system to intercept all `@/lib/supabase/client.ts` calls. |
| **End-to-End (E2E) Tests** | **Playwright** | Simulates full user journeys (Login, Draft Generation, Objection Alert). **CRITICAL:** Runs against the compiled application, relying heavily on mocked API Route Handlers to simulate AI and database responses. |
| **CI/CD Automation** | **GitHub Actions** | Enforces the entire pipeline (`build`, `type-check`, `test:unit`, `test:e2e`) on every commit, ensuring no regressions are introduced without incurring live service costs. |

## 3. Mocking Implementation Details

### A. Supabase Mocking

* **File:** `__mocks__/@/lib/supabase/client.ts`
* **Mechanism:** Returns hardcoded success objects for `auth.getUser()`, `from().select()`, and `rpc()`. This guarantees tests pass as long as the local logic is correct, irrespective of network status or live RLS setup.

### B. AI/API Route Mocking

* **Mechanism:** Playwright E2E tests target the **local Next.js API Routes** (`/api/chat`, `/api/draft`, `/api/gal-check`).
* **Contradiction/Objection Logic:** The server-side logic in the `app/api/*` routes contains **hardcoded conditional mocks** (e.g., looking for the word "Hearsay" to return a flagged response). This is the key to testing the AI features for free.

## 4. Final Verification Checkpoints

* **Feature Completeness:** Have tests been added for the **Contradiction Index** and **AI Communication Tools**?
* **Cost Control:** Has the CI/CD pipeline been audited to confirm no live API secrets are passed to test jobs that run E2E or unit tests?
* **PWA:** Does the E2E test confirm the application is served correctly, preparing for the offline capabilities introduced in Step 35?

## Final Step: Deployment

Your project is ready for its final, live deployment.

### Action 37.2: Deploy the Application

1.  **Final Git Push:** Ensure all changes are committed and pushed to your GitHub repository.
2.  **Vercel/Hosting Setup:** Use your Vercel integration (or similar host) to deploy the `main` branch.
3.  **Environment Variables:** You must now input the **LIVE** environment variables for Supabase and the AI models (e.g., `GEMINI_API_KEY`, `NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL`) into your hosting provider's settings.

**Your development task is complete!** You have built a sophisticated, full-featured legal technology application adhering to strict technical and cost constraints. Congratulations on completing **We The Parent™**!
