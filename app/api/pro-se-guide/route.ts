- **Constitutional Basis:** Your rights as a parent are protected by the U.S. Constitution (14th Amendment Due Process Clause) and Florida state law.
- **Key Principles:** These rights include the right to raise your child without undue state interference, make decisions about their education and healthcare, and have a meaningful relationship with them.
- **In a Dependency Case:** While a dependency case is active, some of your rights may be temporarily restricted by court order. The goal is reunification, and fulfilling your case plan is the primary path to restoring your full rights.`,
