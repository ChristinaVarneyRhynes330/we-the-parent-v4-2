# üìò We The Parent‚Ñ¢ ‚Äì Master GEMINI.md (v2.0 - Iterative)

## 1. üéØ Mission
Build a zero-cost, AI-powered legal assistant for a pro se parent in a Florida juvenile dependency case.
**Top priority:** Repair the foundational issues, get all existing tests to pass, then complete the remaining features in the strict, sequential order outlined in the Project Task Checklist.

## 2. üìú AI Agent Constitution (Unbreakable Rules)
- **Analyze First, Code Second:** Always cite the files you are reviewing before generating any code.
- **Strict Adherence to Blueprint:** Every feature must follow the `API -> Hook -> UI -> Test` pipeline.
- **Sequential Execution:** You must complete the tasks in the checklist (Section 7) in their exact numerical order.
- **Approval Required:** Propose any major architectural changes not listed here and wait for my approval before implementing.
- **Safety & Verification:** Always show a diff before writing to a file. Ensure all code passes TypeScript checks and that its corresponding test is green before considering a task complete.

## 3. workflow Director's Playbook: Prompting Workflow
There are two methods for prompting the agent. You must use the correct one for the task at hand.

- **1. The Iterative Playbook (Primary Method):** For all feature development and bug fixing (any task in the checklist), you **must** use the three-step `Develop -> Verify -> Debug` loop detailed in the separate **Prompt Playbook** document. This is the required workflow to ensure quality and correctness.
- **2. The Prompt Quick Reference (Secondary Method):** The quick reference prompts in Section 9 are for simple, one-off queries or emergency fixes only. They are not a substitute for the full iterative workflow.

## 4. üèõÔ∏è Architectural Blueprint
1.  **Pipeline Rule:** `API -> Hook -> UI -> Test`. This is the required pattern for all feature development.
2.  **Iterative Loop:** The workflow for every task is **`Develop -> Verify -> Debug`**. A task is only complete when its test passes.
3.  **Proactive Intelligence:** New information (document uploads, user chat input) must automatically trigger AI analysis to update the Timeline, Narrative, and other relevant features.

## 5. üîê Environment Variables
* `NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL`
* `NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY`
* `SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY`

## 6. üèóÔ∏è Tech Stack
* **Framework:** Next.js (App Router) with React & TypeScript
* **Styling:** Tailwind CSS
* **Backend:** Supabase (Postgres, Auth, Storage, Edge Functions, pgvector)
* **Testing:** Playwright for E2E testing.
